\section{Datacrawler}
\label{Datacrawler}
The main goal of the datacrawler is to deliver the required datasets as specified in \ref{datasets}. The input to the datacrawler is simply a domain, which is provided by the ground truth. Depending on the configuration the output of the datacrawler can vary from a single screenshot (\ref{DatasetVersion1}) to a complete graph of the given domain (\ref{DatasetVersion2}).


The following section (\ref{datacrawler_requirements}) will profoundly discuss the requirements in functionality for the datacrawler, which will serve as a basis for discussion for the decision between the frameworks \texttt{Puppeeter} and \texttt{Chromium Embedded Framework} (\ref{datacrawler_framework_language}). Afterwards we will give an overview of the architecture (\ref{datacrawler_architecture}) and highlight the idea of \textit{DataModules} in the crawler (\ref{datacrawler_datamodulesystem}). Following that, we will discuss profoundly all developed \textit{DataModules} with their role in the datacrawler (\ref{datacrawler_screenshot_datamodule}, \ref{datacrawler_mobilescreenshot_datamodule}, \ref{datacrawler_url_datamodule}). We will wrap up the internals of the datacrawler by taking a look into the workflow of the datacrawler (\ref{datacrawler_workflow}).

In the last section (\ref{datacrawler_scale}) we will discuss how we successfully designed a sophisticated system to scale-out the datacrawler reducing the total dataset creation time on Google Cloud Platform.  

\subsection{Requirements}
\label{datacrawler_requirements}
The requirements in functionality for the datacrawler arise from the dataset specifications (\ref{datasetversion1}, \ref{datasetversion2}). The next section will derive the requirements from the dataset specifications and discuss them profoundly.

\subsubsection{Browser Emulation}
One of the major requirements for the datacrawler is to find a convenient way of emulating a web browser. According to the dataset specifications, for every given website a screenshot $\tensorsym{I}$ has to be taken. In addition to that, every screenshot must represent the website as the user would see in a common browser. The latter and other attributes such as the loading time $l$ of a website like in a common browser make the emulation of a browser an inevitable requirement. 

\subsubsection{Information Accessibility}
Accessing \textit{low-level} information such as the \textit{HTTP-Request} to change the \textit{user-agent} to generate a mobile screenshot $\tensorsym{M}$ (\ref{datacrawler_mobilescreenshot_datamodule}) or the \textit{Document Object Model} (\ref{datacrawler_url_datamodule}) to generate edges $a$ in the graph according to dataset version 2 specification (\ref{DatasetVersion2}) is inevitable. The datacrawler has to be able to manipulate internal data structures and even able to inject own \textit{JavaScript-code} (\ref{datacrawler_screenshot_datamodule}) on the website.

\subsubsection{Modularity}
The datacrawler has to be as modular for allowing us to extend the datacrawler easily and decide which attribute should be calculated. This requirement in flexibility is raised from the fact that our dataset specifications might change over the time or new ones might be added.

This flexibility led to a sophisticated architecture such as the \text{DataModule-System} (\ref{datacrawler_datamodulesystem}), which makes the it possible to pass the dataset specification directly into the datacrawler.

\subsubsection{Scalability}
Both dataset versions require the analysis of at least 100,000 websites. Therefore, datacrawler has to be horizontally scalable to allow the analysis of multiple domains at once, and efficient in terms analysis time and start-up time. An inefficient and not scalable datacrawler would lead to multiple days of required analysis time and reflect also in high infrastructure costs.
