\subsection{Rank Predictor}

Purpose and high level overview

Enumerate components (not classes) and explain each of them with details

Analysis scripts: just purpose

Data: may be reused, classes for v1 and v2, interface of the dataset classes, parallel loading is simple with PyTorch so the GPU is kept busy, maybe sample snippet

Models: name them and reference to method

Trainer: orchestration scripts, loss, evaluation; mention Sacred and TensorBoard
