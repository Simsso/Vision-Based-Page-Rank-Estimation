\subsection{Graph Network Library}

Abstract (features, purpose)

Alternatives: DeepMind's, not chosen bc TF and we wanted to have full understanding and learning.

Overview of classes, internal structure, maybe more details on aforementioned features. General concept of generic classes and implementations done by the user. Some default implementations are provided

Elaborate on each class and name details.

Future improvements: parallelize, CUDA ops, more default implementations
