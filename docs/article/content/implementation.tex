\section{Implementation Details}

As part of this xxx four separate pieces of software: list them, with note on dependencies.

For the ML parts (gn and rankpred): Implemented in PyTorch. Alternative framework TF not chosen bc of (1) non-laziness by the time of writing, (2) complicated data pipelines, (3) less OOP-friendly.

The following sub-sections explain the details for each piece separately. Special focus on GN lib because it may be used by others whereas rankpred and human eval where rather tools.
