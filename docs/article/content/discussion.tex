\section{Discussion and Analysis}

In this section we discuss our results, and analyze the model internals.

\subsection{Accuracy}

Difficulty of the task, human score, comparison with human score.

There is definitely a correlation, both humans and model find them. Model exceeds human performance (super-human).

Question of upper limit (aspects: plain impossibility, dataset noise, problem of similar and high ranks)

Dataset size, no overfitting, larger model helpful?

Is the model good at easy pairs and bad at hard ones? Tweaked accuracy score consideration and computation. Is the accuracy score unfair?

\subsection{Model Understanding}

Filters not helpful

Activation maps

Hard and easy samples

Gradient

each + Helpfulness of the extracted information and Comparison with human behavior (qualitative)
